```
both arguments are required:

### Docker

You can use the Dockerfile to build an docker image and run the script in its own isolated container. It is recommend to provide a volume to persist the data between each run. You can specify the arguments `year` and `minutes` as environment variables when creating/starting the container:

```sh
docker run --env YEAR=2019 --env MINUTES=30 --rm --volume $(pwd)/AIS-data:/data --name=mari-data_harvester 52north/mari-data_harvester:1.0.0
